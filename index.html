  <h2>Gothenburg Categories and Types Seminar</h2>
<hr>

<p>
  A biweekly seminar on category theory and type theory based at the <a href="https://gu.se">University of Gothenburg</a> and <a href="https://chalmers.se">Chalmers University of Technology</a>. The seminar is shared between the <a href="https://logic-gu.se">Logic Group</a> at FLoV and the <a href="">Type Theory group</a> at the Computer Science department.
<p>
  Information on remote participation may appear in the future.

    <h4>Reid Barton: &ldquo;Exponentiability relative to a class of maps&rdquo;</h4>
    <blockquote>
      A morphism f of a category with pullbacks is called exponentiable when
      base change along f has a right adjoint. This talk introduces a
      variation of this notion that requires a right adjoint to base change
      of maps belonging to a distinguished class R. To be well-behaved, such
      right adjoints must satisfy extra conditions. We prove the equivalence
      of several such conditions and say that f is R-exponentiable when
      these conditions hold. One application is to the interpretation of Pi
      types in intensional type theory. This notion also provides a general
      setting for a phenomenon in which two different classes of maps are
      exponentiable relative to each other: for instance, open and closed
      embeddings of topological spaces. Joint work with Joseph Hua (CMU).

    <h4><a href="https://diliberti.github.io/">Ivan Di Liberti</a>: &ldquo;Fragments of Geometric Logic&rdquo;</h4>
    <blockquote>
      I present a framework recently introduced in collaboration with Lingyuan Ye (arXiv:2504.16690) to organise and study many existing fragments of geometric logic (essentially algebraic, regular, disjunctive, coherent...). The framework was recently used to deliver a modular proof of Craig interpolation that extendes to almost all finitary fragments (arXiv:2601.11221). I will also introduce open problems and some future directions.
