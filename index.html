    <h4>Reid Barton: &ldquo;Exponentiability relative to a class of maps&rdquo;</h4>
    <blockquote>
      A morphism f of a category with pullbacks is called exponentiable when
      base change along f has a right adjoint. This talk introduces a
      variation of this notion that requires a right adjoint to base change
      of maps belonging to a distinguished class R. To be well-behaved, such
      right adjoints must satisfy extra conditions. We prove the equivalence
      of several such conditions and say that f is R-exponentiable when
      these conditions hold. One application is to the interpretation of Pi
      types in intensional type theory. This notion also provides a general
      setting for a phenomenon in which two different classes of maps are
      exponentiable relative to each other: for instance, open and closed
      embeddings of topological spaces. Joint work with Joseph Hua (CMU).
